The file boilerplate.go is written to accomodate the JIRA issue https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/5461
to replace the boilerplate.py that exist inside minikube.

The objective of the boilerplate.py is to check whether the code inside minikube has the appropriate
licensing on top of the file.
